                Marty and April have been building together for years, driven by the same belief:<br />
                technology should bring people closer.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
                Marty was drawn to live connection—spaces where people actually show up through video.<br />
                April wanted to connect people globally through language learning.

              <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
                As vibecoding took off, apps shipped faster than ever.<br />
                But many of them felt empty.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
                The problem wasn&apos;t AI.<br />
                It was the lack of real human presence.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
                So they built VibeLive—invisible infrastructure that brings live video into vibecoded apps.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
                Because in the AI era, human connection isn&apos;t a feature.<br />
                It&apos;s the foundation.

              <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
                I started vibecoding a few months ago.<br />
                Since then, I&apos;ve built six apps.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
                It got so addictive that I stopped watching Netflix.<br />
                Shipping felt incredible.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
                But something felt off.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
                Every app worked — yet felt lonely.<br />
                Users showed up, clicked around, and left. No presence. No energy. No humans.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
                AI can write code.<br />
                But it can&apos;t create togetherness.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
                So I built VibeLive — invisible infrastructure that adds live video inside vibecoded apps.<br />
                No WebRTC. No servers. No friction. Just real people, present where your users already are.

                In the AI era, human connection isn&apos;t a feature.<br />
