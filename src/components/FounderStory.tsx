            Why I built VibeLive

              I have been vibecoding for the past year. Building apps faster than ever. Shipping ideas that used to take months in just days.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
              But every app I built felt the same way: functional, but empty. Users would sign up, look around, and leave. There was no life in them.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
              I realized what was missing: real people. Not AI assistants. Not chatbots. Actual human presence. The feeling that someone else is here, right now, with you.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-text mb-6">
              So I built VibeLive. Invisible infrastructure that unlocks video inside any vibecoded app. Because in the AI era, human connection is not a feature. It is the whole point.
